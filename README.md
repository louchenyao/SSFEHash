Supersuper Fast and Efficient Hash Table

SSFEHash acts like a hash table, except it returns a random value when the key is not in the table.

## How does it work?

![ssfe.jpg](ssfe.jpg)

In a nutshell, the result of a key is queried by the xor of three values from an array via three indexes generated by a hash function.

SSFE solves a system of linear equations over GF(2) to construct the array conforming to the query results.
