# SSFEHash
Supersuper Fast and  Efficient Hash Table

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/louchenyao/SSFEHash/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/louchenyao/SSFEHash/actions)

In a nutshell, the result of a key is queried by XOR of three values from an array indexed through three indexes generated by three different hash functions. The difference between SSFEHash and the canonical hash table is that when querying on a key, which is not in the hash table, SSFEHash returns a random value.
